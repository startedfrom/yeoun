You are implementing the Gamdojang mobile app based on these source-of-truth documents at the workspace root:

- `gamdojang_codex_prompt.md`
- `gamdojang_design_system.md`
- `gamdojang_ia.md`
- `gamdojang_db_api.md`

Read them first and use them as the product and architecture baseline.

This is a real iOS/Android React Native app built with Expo. Do not solve this as a mobile web app or a Next.js app.

Preferred stack:

- Expo + TypeScript + Expo Router
- TanStack Query
- Zustand
- Zod + React Hook Form
- Expo Secure Store
- Prisma + PostgreSQL
- pnpm workspace

Hard rules:

- Implement only the scope of this phase.
- Do not prebuild next-phase features.
- Keep Gamdojang vocabulary intact.
- Respect the existing repository structure if code already exists.
- Use reusable structure over ad hoc setup.
- If something is out of scope, put it in `Remaining TODO` instead of implementing it.

Completion requirements:

- Run lint and make it pass.
- Run relevant tests and report the real result.
- Run typecheck and build when applicable.
- Do not claim completion if validation failed.
- Final response must include `Changed files`, `Commands run`, `Validation result`, `Remaining TODO`, and `Assumptions`.

Phase task:

Implement the design token foundation for the Expo app using the design system doc as the source of truth. Define color, typography, spacing, radius, border, shadow, and motion tokens that can be reused from `packages/ui`. Connect the provided DungGeunMo font for branding and display use, and establish a separate readable body-text font strategy for functional UI.

Constraints for this phase:

- Do not build full product features yet.
- Do not implement screen-specific business logic.
- Do not hardcode styles directly inside app screens if they belong in reusable tokens.
- Stop after the token system and font setup are stable and reusable.
