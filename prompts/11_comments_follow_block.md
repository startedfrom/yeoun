You are implementing the Gamdojang mobile app based on these source-of-truth documents at the workspace root:

- `gamdojang_codex_prompt.md`
- `gamdojang_design_system.md`
- `gamdojang_ia.md`
- `gamdojang_db_api.md`

Read them first and use them as the product and architecture baseline.

This is a real iOS/Android React Native app built with Expo. Do not solve this as a mobile web app or a Next.js app.

Preferred stack:

- Expo + TypeScript + Expo Router
- TanStack Query
- Zustand
- Zod + React Hook Form
- Expo Secure Store
- Prisma + PostgreSQL
- pnpm workspace

Hard rules:

- Implement only the scope of this phase.
- Do not prebuild next-phase features.
- Keep Gamdojang vocabulary intact.
- Respect the existing repository structure if code already exists.
- Use reusable structure over ad hoc setup.
- If something is out of scope, put it in `Remaining TODO` instead of implementing it.

Completion requirements:

- Run lint and make it pass.
- Run relevant tests and report the real result.
- Run typecheck and build when applicable.
- Do not claim completion if validation failed.
- Final response must include `Changed files`, `Commands run`, `Validation result`, `Remaining TODO`, and `Assumptions`.

Phase task:

Implement comments, follow behavior, privacy-aware follow policies, and user blocking. Support comment CRUD, follow and unfollow, private-account follow handling where applicable, and block relationships that consistently affect feed visibility, profile access, and DM entry points. Authorization behavior should be centralized and reusable rather than copied into each feature route.

Constraints for this phase:

- Do not implement inbox messaging or notification delivery yet.
- Do not leave block and privacy policy partially applied.
- Keep the product safe and consistent with the moderation-minded documentation.
- Stop after community interaction and access-control behavior are stable.
